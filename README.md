# war_room_viewer

A basic card catalog.  The goal for this sucker is to assist in a closed source game project I'm working on.  While the game might be closed source, this card catalog will be universal.

#### What?
- create CSV `pipe separated` data files for your favorite systems
- modeled after the rank/paragon unit system made popular by **Warcraft III** and **Starcraft:BW**
- add animated portrait and unit `pngs`, `jpegs`, and [gifs](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/e/ed/Marine_SC2_GameAnim1.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080605172207).
- run as many analytics and diagnostics as you prefer on their databanks.  Min-Max~!
